    "Let us go through the details of GitHub Branches.\n",
    "* We typically come up with branching strategy based up on the environments we have with our application.\n",
    "* For example, dev, qa/main, production, etc. There might be others as well.\n",
    "* We typically enable CI/CD on qa/main, production branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the typical deployment process.\n",
    "* Developers develop their code in feature specific branch and then place pull request into the developer branch. These feature specific branches are typically short lived.\n",
    "* Once the development is done along with unit testing, developers will place pull request to merge their changes to qa/main branch.\n",
    "* The code might be reviewed and approved by the lead. As soon as the lead approves the changes, they will be merged into qa/main branch.\n",
    "* Once the changes are merged into qa/main branch, it needs to be built and deployed on QA environment for testing.\n",
    "* After the application is tested by QA team, they will place pull request to merge the code into Production branch. Once approved application will be deployed in Production Environment."
