    "## Recap of Manual Deployment Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us quickly recap of the manual deployment process for our simple web application developed using Flask.\n",
    "* Deployment can be divided into baseline (one time every major upgrade) and incremental.\n",
    "* We can take care of pre-requisites of baseline deployment manually or using server automation tools such as Ansible.\n",
    "* After taking care of pre-requisites we should enable CI/CD so that the process of incremental deployments are streamlined.\n",
    "* For our project, we need to have following before enabling CI/CD.\n",
    "  * A Database Server to persist our application data.\n",
    "  * An Ubuntu based Server to deploy and run our application.\n",
    "  * A functional user specific to application which can be used for the deployment.\n",
    "  * Right version of Python with tools such as pip.\n",
    "  * A supervisor process to control the application.\n",
    "  * Proxy server such as nginx to redirect the external traffic via http or https to the application servers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Once we have all the above in place we can work on setting up CI/CD Pipeline using solutions such as GitHub Actions."
